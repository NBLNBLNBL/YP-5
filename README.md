# WeFlow

A minimal Streamlit interface with a futuristic style.

## Setup

Install dependencies and run the app:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Set `WEBHOOK_URL` in your environment if you want the app to forward text to
a remote webhook. When unset, the response is echoed locally.
